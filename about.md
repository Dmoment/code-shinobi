	<p class="intro">Hey there! I'm a full-stack Rails developer since 2019, keen on building efficient and scalable applications. Though I've got Ruby on Rails and Agile methodologies down, I'm still wrestling a bit with CSS. But hey, who's perfect, right? I'm all about team collaboration and contributing to cool projects. So, here I am, ready to learn, grow, and drive success.

	<h2>Stuff I've Figured Out Along the Way</h2>
	<p>Hey there! I've picked up a thing or two on this crazy ride as a developer. Here's the gist:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Sharing what I know? It's a no-brainer. We all learn, we all grow. Win-win, right?</li>
		<li>I try to do stuff that's out of the ordinary. Being different isn't just cool, it's where all the fun stuff happens.</li>
		<li>Learning things the hard way? Sounds tough, but trust me, it's worth it. Nothing like a challenge to make you appreciate the nitty-gritty of coding.</li>
		<li>I'm all about diving headfirst into what interests me. Mastering your craft isn't just about being the best - it's a heck of a lot of fun too.</li>
		<li>Everything I do leaves an impression on someone else. So, why not make it a good one? Great design isn't just nice to look at, it changes how we experience the world.</li>
		<li>Know your worth and don't sell yourself short. I pour my heart and soul into my work, and it shows.</li>
		<li>Scary things aren't so scary once you give them a shot. Some of the best surprises have come from stepping outside my comfort zone.</li>
		<li>Want to be a coding whiz? There's no big secret. Write tons of code, use your software like there's no tomorrow, and voilà!</li>
		<li>What's the coolest thing about writing software? Easy. We get to boss machines around and make them do incredible stuff. How cool is that?</li>
	</ul>
